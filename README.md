Etch-a-Sketch is one of the final projects in The Odin Projects foundations course.

I am supposed to create something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, 
to practice DOM manipulation, GIT, and searching for solutions to problems online.

The program takes a number as input from a player and creates a square grid
of squares within 960 pixels.

The player is then able to click on the squares to "draw" on the grid.
